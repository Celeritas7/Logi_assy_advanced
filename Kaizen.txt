I can add Child with option "Add child" but I cant delete any block after right click.

Whenever I add new  child the block positions which I fix get disturbed after it.

To resolve it I want a option to lock the block position. Once locked that block will move only when its parent moved. The position of the child block and parent block should be fixed after locked.

I want a universal chatbot which will be adaptable to the database input I will give to it.


I should have been able generate new block inside my database, check status of tasks inside my database with question. Should be able to change the status of tasks inside my database. If there will be any reason bcz of which I can't work on any task I should have been able to write the note for reason bcz of which the task to be kept on hold.

I'm still now sure how I can add a child to perticular parent using this chatbot. So keep this point on hold. We will discuss it while creating the chatbot.
